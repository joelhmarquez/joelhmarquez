description: Advice to current (or future) DACA receipients
---

Among all of the stresses and otherwise negative experiences that being undocumented brought me, one positive experience has been meeting other people in similar situations and getting to hear about their stories: everything that they have overcome and what they are up to now. There is always a ton of inspiration to be found within them and I am able to take away pieces of advice from each of them.

Although I am no longer a DACA recipient, I am still active in many DACA communities and I love to interact with people, learn from them and give advice whenever I can. One thing that I am frequently asked about is my experience going through an employment based sponsorship as a DACA recipient and any advice that I have for others looking to do the same. Specific immigration advice is hard to provide given how dependent it is on an individual's specifc immigration situation, but these questions have made me reflect on the general approaches and values that I have relied on throughout my life which have led me to where I am today. Below are three pieces of advice that I've applied throughtout the different stages of my life which I credit to helping guide me to the life I live today.

1. **Be curious; be proactive.** This are two traits that I strive to have in all aspects of my life and ones that I particularly believe were a big reason in allowing me find a pathway to residency when the options seemed limited if not outright non-existent. I highly recommend all Dreamers dedicate time to researching different immigration pathways to permanent residency and learn if/how you may be able to pursue one or more of them. My advice is to learn about the steps in each process and what their requirements are and then analyze whether you meet them. If not, see if there are any exceptions to the requirements that you do not meet and figure out if you qualify for those. One key learning that I found out early on was the fact that one of the biggest roadblocks preventing undocumented immigrants from pursuing a legal pathway is having accrued unlawful presence, which then ultimately results in a bar from entering the US for 3 or 10 years. Knowing that, along with the fact that DACA prevents the accrual of unlawful presence (there was also some luck involved in having had DACA before the age of 18) allowed me to pursue an employment based permanent residency sponsorship without hitting the roadblock that prevents so many others from doing so.
	
2. **Advocate for the creation/expansion of pathways to permanent residency.** When researching the different pathways to permanent residency, you'll quickly learn how easy it is to be disqualified from any given pathway, a lot of times at no fault of your own. For example, as mentioned above, one big reason for disqualification is the accrual of unlawful presence. For a lot of dreamers, accruing unlawful presence was inevitable because they turned 18 prior to the program being created or perhaps they are turning 18 now and cannot apply to DACA given it's current "blocked-for-new-applicants" state. While comprehensive immigration reform should be the goal, if the unlawful presence requirement could be removed or if additional waivers/exceptions were created, it would open up the existing immigration pathways for so many people. This is one example but of course there are many other requirements which if removed, would open up pathways for a large number of people. This is why it is crutial to keep the momentum and public pressure going at all times to urge congress men and women to bring these solutions to life.

3. **Focus on what you can control.** This one is for your own sanity's sake. It can get extremely overwhelming trying to plan your life when your future so heavily relies on external factors outside of your control. It's important to break down your goals into smaller ones such that you can always work towards them regardless of what else is going on around you. For me, this meant keeping focus on the immediate goal at every stage of my life. While in college, this meant focusing on completing my degree and becoming educated. Regardless of what the future was to bring, I knew that my education was something that I could never be stripped of. Similarly, once graduating college, I focused on getting my dream job. At the time, DACA had been rescinded and the deferred action and work authorization permit that was active for me at the time was set to be my last. That meant that I would only have a few months of work before my work authorization would run out and I would no longer be able to remain in the country and work. It could have been easy to give up at that moment, but I focused on what was in my control: interviewing and landing job offers. I did just that and everything else fell into place. A few months after accepting a job offer, DACA was reinstated by the courts and several years later I completed an employment based permanent residency sponsorship and I am now a permanent resident. If you focus on what you can control and work on one thing at a time (while aligned to your larger plans of course), things seem to just work out in the end.
