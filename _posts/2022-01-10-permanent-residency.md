description: From DACA to permanent resident via employment based sponsorship
---

After living in the U.S. for 16 years; 8 of those under the protections and benefits of the DACA program, I finally became a permanent resident in August of 2021.
It was something I dreamed of for a long time and now, months later, it still feels quite surreal.

Below is an overview of the timeline of my employment based sponsorship process.
