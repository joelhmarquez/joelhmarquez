I am always excited to meet and get to know fellow DACA recipients; their stories never cease to amaze me. While I find comfort in the similarities we share in our upbringing, struggles and obstacles to get to where we are, I am equally as excited when learning about our differences. Iâ€™ve come to know a large number of Dreamers over the last few years and I have been surprised by the amount of diversity in our community.

My curiosity has led me to reading through the quarterly reports that USCIS releases which highlight population and performance statistics relating to the DACA program. Not getting enough clarity from the pdf files provided, I decided to create an interactive data visualization tool to present the data in such a way that is easy to understand and that allows us to easily compare the statistics year-to-year.

<a href="https://www.joelhmarquez.com/dacaanalytics" target="_blank" ref="noopener">DACA Analytics</a> provides a variety of visualizations of the USCIS data. It is split into two main sections: population and performance data.

The population data includes population by age group, sex, marital status, birth country and state of residence. The first three are presented in bar and line graphs that allow us to see the changes from year to year as well as how the values within each category compare to one another. The birth country and state of residence statistics are presented in two different forms. The first is through interactive geomaps in which you could select the year of the dataset to be used. You can then hover over the maps and get a count of population for a given country or state, respectively, according to the dataset from the selected year. The second form is through line graphs that allow you to explore the changes in population for a given country or state throughout time.

The performance data focuses on the administrative side of the program; providing information on how many applications are accepted, rejected, approved and denied each year. The visualizations you will find for this category include line graphs that show the volume of each year-over-year since the inception of the program.

I am hopeful that this tool will be of use to those of you who are curious about the make-up of DACA beneficiaries or who are curious to see the patterns in initial/renewal applications submitted to USCIS, how they are processed, and their ultimate outcome. I will continue to update the tools as new information is released and will work on adding additional visualizations for the data that I have yet to explore.
