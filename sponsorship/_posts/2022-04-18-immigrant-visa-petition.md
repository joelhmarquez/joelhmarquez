The second step in the process is an immigrant worker visa petition filed by your employer to classify you as eligible for an immigrant visa based on employment.

In this step, your employer will prove that they have the means to pay you the offered wage as well as prove that you meet the qualifications required for the position as described in the PERM labor certification.

Like the labor certification step, much of this step will be handled by your employer, but this step may require you to provide supporting documents to be used on your petition. Your attorney will provide further guidance on this but depending on the job requirements listed for your position, you will need to gather supporting evidence to prove that you meet such qualifications. 

## Documents
Examples of documents you *may* need include:
-	Copy of college degree
-	Proof of prior experience (employment verification letters)
-	Proof of prior experience (educational letters attesting to your learning/acquiring of necessary skills/experience)

## Tips
- Create a list of all your former employments along with relevant dates (start/end), your title, skills/experience needed/learned and contact information for the establishment.
- Do the same for educational institutions that you attended/graduated from. Take note of relevant courses that you took that align with the qualifications required for your position, important dates, and contact information for relevant staff/faculty who can attest to your learnings.
